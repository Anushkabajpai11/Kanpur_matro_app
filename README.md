**Kanpur Metro App**

**Overview**

This Java-based application provides a route planner for the Kanpur Metro system, utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between stations.

**Features**

**Station Search:** Users can search for metro stations by name or location.

**Route Planning:** The app calculates the optimal route between two stations based on the shortest distance.

**Real-time Updates:** (Planned) Integration with the Kanpur Metro system to provide real-time information on train schedules and delays.
